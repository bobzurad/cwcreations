cwcreations
===========
This is my own personal experiment at creating a web app using node.js. My intention is to create an application that my wife can use to sell her handmade creations online. My secondary objective is to use this project as an example that anyone can use to learn how to build web apps using node.js.

#Development
Developing this project requires
* [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [npm](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/85484771375/how-to-install-npm)
* [bower](http://bower.io)

After you've installed node.js npm and bower, clone this repository and run:

```bash
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

You can then run the app locally at http://localhost:8001 by running:
```bash
$ npm start
```
